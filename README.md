# dmsh-sfml
This is a recreation of my (almost) DMSH game in Unity.
In the future, I want to recreate this project as a Touhou Dolls in Pseudo Paradise game, but with my own ideas.
For this project, I used SFML because I didn't want to research how to implement many "things"; I just wanted to create a game using my small "game engine" (which is actually framework-based, lol).
